# üì¶ AI-Powered Supply Chain Analytics (n8n + PostgreSQL + Quadratic)

An end-to-end analytics solution that identifies inefficiencies in organic food distribution across India and US markets using modern AI tools.

## üåü Key Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline**: n8n workflows that monitor emails, process attachments, and load to database
- **AI-Driven Insights**: Natural language queries in Quadratic to analyze supply chain performance
- **Critical KPIs**: Calculates On-Time In-Full (OTIF), line fill rate, and volume fill rate metrics
- **Multi-Region Support**: Comparative analysis between Gujarat (India) and New Jersey (US) operations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Workflow Automation** | n8n | Extracts CSVs from emails and loads to PostgreSQL |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL (Supabase) | Stores order data with fact/dimension tables |
| **Analytics Engine** | Quadratic | AI-powered spreadsheet for prompt-based analysis |
| **Visualization** | Quadratic Charts | Interactive performance dashboards |

## üìà Business Insights Uncovered

1. **Delivery Performance**
   - Identified 23% revenue loss from incomplete orders
   - Calculated average 2.4-day delay for late deliveries

2. **Customer Analysis**
   - Ranked top 5 customers with OTIF issues
   - Compared regional performance (India vs US)

3. **Product Analysis**
   - Highlighted 3 product categories with <85% fill rates
   - Quantified inventory gaps causing delivery failures
